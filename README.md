## What is ACM-ICPC

From [Official ICPC website](https://icpc.baylor.edu/) "The International Collegiate Programming Contest is an algorithmic programming contest for college students. Teams of three, representing their university, work to solve the most real-world problems, fostering collaboration, creativity, innovation, and the ability to perform under pressure. Through training and competition, teams challenge each other to raise the bar on the possible. Quite simply, it is the oldest, largest, and most prestigious programming contest in the world."

## Motivational lines from the Founder of CompeteMcGill

Computer science (CS) is a rich and powerful field that opens the door for you to work in an impactful and far-reaching industry that will help shape humanity's future in the next decades! Although many technologies exist today, many of them will fade away and new ones will emerge giving you an endless stream of new things to learn. However, most of the skills in CS converge into one main skill which is problem-solving. Competitive programming is basically a sport where people practice-problem by solving algorithmic challenges in a fun manner! By doing competitive programming you will build a very solid foundation in CS that will help you further on in your journey whatever it is, so buckle up and enjoy it!

## Contest rules and structure

* **Eligibility**: Need to be a full-time student in any program and not too old to participate. If you're 18-22 years old and studying full time in McGill then you should be fine. If concerned check [here](https://icpc.baylor.edu/regionals/rules) and for more info.
* **Programming languages allowed**: C/C++, Java, Python3, Python2, Pascal.
* **Cost**: Totally Free! CS department and CompeteMcGill will take care of the costs of the whole trip, so it's basically a free trip for you!

* **Team size**: 3 students with only one PC
* **Contest stages** relative to McGill teams:
    1) **Local stage** usually held at **McGill**, we are typically only allowed to move only 2 teams to next stage.
    2) **Preliminary Regionals** multiple contests held in the northeast part of NA. Around 4-5 are held in the US and one is held in Canada. We almost always aim to participate in a contest in the US since some of them are easier than others. So a US Visa or citizenship might be needed. Only one team move to the next stage.
    3) **Regionals** same as **Preliminary Regionals** except that it's definitely hosted in the US and big universities like MIT, Harvard, ... etc will be there.
    4) **World finals** held in a new country each year (Portugal for 2018). If you made it to this stage then companies will fight for your attention and internships will drop on you like rain. So congratulations my friend! No need to worry about the results of this contest nor prepare for any algorithmic interviews ever again, you have seen many of the hardest puzzles in CS.
    
        However, if your goal is not just to get a job, which is kind of expected for someone who reached this stage. If you end in the top 10 then I salute with all my heart, you made it to the top and will be rewarded with a medal and eternal glory, make sure to enjoy that to the max!

* **Reference Material**: You are allowed to bring textbooks, notes, slides ... or basically anything you might need for the contest. Usually, there is a limit to the number of pages you can bring (around 25 pages for world finals). See [Resources](##Resources) for examples of good references to bring to the contest.

## Training Schedule - Winter 2019

Training will be mostly done through solving problems either on online judges or from previous ICPC contests.

This section will be updated throughout the semester.
